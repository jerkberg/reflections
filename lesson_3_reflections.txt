When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

A remote repository is useful if you want to share files between users who can't 
share the same computer. Another use for a remote repository is if you want to be 
able to access your work from multiple computers or work sites.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You wouldn't want Git to automatically pull from the remote repository in case
someone else added or removed something that would interfere with the work you
were doing in your working directory.
