What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, Git creates hidden metadata within that
directory. This step is necessary because the metadata needs to exist before
Git can start tracking the differences between commits. When you first
initialize a repository, Git does not make a commit. So there's no version
history until you make the first commit manually.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that you can
selectively upload specific files to the staging area rather than the
entire directory. The staging area is different from the repository because
it is just a temporary space to organize files before you save them to a
commit. The value of the staging area is that you can organize the files
you use in a commit based on a single conceptual idea. It helps you organize
clear, intuitive commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

The staging area allows you to compare a specific file or files with what's in 
the most recent commit. That way you can see exactly what changes will be made 
in the next commit. So if there are multiple unrelated changes, you can go back 
and change the file in the staging area so that every change is related to the same
conceptual idea.
